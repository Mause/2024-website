Multitudes guides engineering teams to become happier and higher-performing with data-driven insights. We pull data from tools like GitHub, Jira, PagerDuty, and Google Calendar to surface what’s holding back your engineering team. With research-backed metrics covering DORA, SPACE, and DevEx, we detect what work is blocked, who’s at risk of burnout, and more. Then our Slack nudges hook into the team’s daily workflow to make it easier for teams to take action and, ultimately, deliver more value.
